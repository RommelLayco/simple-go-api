# 3. Complexity of Helm Chart

Date: 2022-01-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on how complex we want the helm chart to be. Things to consider but not limited to

* security context
* Ingress rules
* install aws-load-balancer-controller
* resource policies

## Decision

We will create the simplist helm chart possible to deploy the application. For example using using the builtin load balancer service to create an ELB

## Consequences

The application may not be as secure as possible:

* Missing security context.
* Sizing of pods may consume to many resources

May not be minimiusing cost e.g. using classic load balancer instead of creating an ALB
