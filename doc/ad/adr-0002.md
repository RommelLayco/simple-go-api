# 2. Application will be deployed using AWS EKS

Date: 2021-12-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on what type of infrstructure we want to run the application on.

## Decision

We will run the app as a container as there will be minimal code changes need. We will use EKS as we do not need to manage the control plane of EKS. This will make building and deploying the application quicker.

## Consequences

* A docker image was created
* We are exposing the server to listen on port 8080
* To access dynamodb we need to assoicate a Service Account with the pod. This Service account will need to be mapped to a role with permissions to talk to Dynamodb
