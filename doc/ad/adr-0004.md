# 4. IAM roles for service accounts

Date: 2022-01-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs access to dynmaodb to add, update and get items. The application will therefore require IAM permissions.

## Decision

We will use [IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) as this will allow us to use the principle of least privillege. Restricting the required AWS permissions to this application.

## Consequences

EKS cluster will need to be configured to use IAM roles for service accounts
