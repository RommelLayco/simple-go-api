# 4. Terraform to create EKS stack

Date: 2022-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

An EKS stack is required to run this helm chart.

## Decision

We will create the stack using terraform. The stack will be created using a local state file.

## Consequences

* This project cannot be saftely shared for deployments as the local state file does not provide locking
* User will need to supply a IAM role
* You will require valid aws credentials to connect to the cluster using EKS see <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-cluster-connection/>
